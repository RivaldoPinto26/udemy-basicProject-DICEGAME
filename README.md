# SIMPLE DICE GAME

This is a simple Dice Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game simulates rolling two diceâ€”one for Player 1 and one for Player 2. After both dice are rolled, the game compares the results and declares a winner based on which player has the higher number. If both players roll the same number, it's a draw.

## Code Explanation

- Create random number and multiply it to 6 than plus to 1 so we can get value 1-6, save it in variable
- Create new variable to put string source of images, just concatenate the strings.
- Applying DOM so we can add image to our element in HTML.
- use if statements to compare the value of dice than than after that use DOM again to change the title.

## How to Play

Simply refresh the page to roll the dice for both players and see the result!
